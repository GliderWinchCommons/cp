Remote Control Panel code

A Java program that provides the equivalent of a hardware Control Panel to the Master Controller Control Panel.  The hardware control panel provides status LEDs, LCD display, switches, and a control lever.  This program duplicates the hardware items on a PC, and as such can be used as a remote control panel, and addition to, or replacing, the hardware control panel.
